This repo is for tracking what I want to read, watch and listen to, what I have read, and maybe some other self-education stuff.

I'm putting it all here partially so that if other people have suggestions for what I _should_ be reading, you can add them with a pull request (kind nerdy but the option is there). Also feel free to raid it for ideas about what to read yourself.

I'll probably connect this to my [marginalia series](https://www.hughrundle.net/tag/marginalia/) by linking to the relevant post after I 'review' it.

# To suggest a book to read

Either log a pull request to update `to-be-read.md` or create an issue.

# To offer to lend me something
